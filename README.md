# personal-project-2
Personal, unfinished, project to work on web design. The project was coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The coding occurred between the fall and winter semesters, so it remains unfinished as other, more pressing, projects arose. This web development was meant to be a tool for players and fans of Dungeons and Dragons, the famous role-playing game. 

The first page to open in the code is called **home**. The rest of the pages are linked through the code.
